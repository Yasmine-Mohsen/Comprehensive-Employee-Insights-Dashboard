# Comprehensive Employee Insights Dashboard

## Overview

This project involves developing a dashboard to analyze and visualize employee data, focusing on gender breakdown, managerial comparisons, and salary analysis. The dashboard provides insights into gender distribution, managerial representation, and salary trends across departments.

## Features

- **Employee Breakdown by Gender:**
  - Visualized the number of male and female employees from 1990 onwards.
  - Created a chart showing the gender distribution of new hires each year, e.g., 60% male vs. 40% female.
  - Analyzed trends in the number of employees over time.

- **Manager Gender Comparison:**
  - Compared the number of male and female managers across different departments for each year, starting from 1990.

- **Salary Comparison by Gender:**
  - Compared the average salary of female versus male employees up to the year 2002.
  - Included a filter to view salary comparisons by department.

- **SQL Stored Procedure for Salary Analysis:**
  - Developed an SQL stored procedure to calculate the average salary of male and female employees per department within a user-defined salary range.
  - Visualized the result-set in Tableau as a double bar chart.

## Data Sources

- **Employee Records:** Includes information on employee gender, hiring dates, managerial positions, and salaries.
- **Department Information:** Contains details on departments and their respective employee counts.
